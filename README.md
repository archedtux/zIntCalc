# zIntCalc
A very basic program to calculate 90, 95, and 99% z-intervals.

This repo is just me testing how to git.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have gcc installed through your package manager
2. Download thing.c
3. Run `gcc thing.c` and generate a.out
4. Run a.out by typing `./a.out`

There are no command line options for this program.
